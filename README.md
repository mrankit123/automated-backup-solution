# Automated Backup Solution

This project automates the backup process for an Amazon RDS instance, using AWS Lambda for automation, Amazon S3 for metadata storage, and Amazon CloudWatch for scheduling and monitoring. It also incorporates cost optimization strategies using Amazon S3 lifecycle policies.

## Project Overview
The Automated Backup Solution performs the following tasks:
- Takes periodic snapshots of an Amazon RDS instance.
- Stores backup metadata in Amazon S3.
- Automates backup scheduling with CloudWatch Events.
- Transitions older backups to Amazon S3 Glacier for cost-effective long-term storage.

## Architecture
The project uses a serverless architecture with the following AWS services:
- **Amazon RDS**: The primary database being backed up.
- **AWS Lambda**: Handles the backup process, triggered by CloudWatch.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores metadata and manages backup lifecycle.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Manages scheduling and monitoring.

## Features
- Automated RDS snapshots.
- CloudWatch-based scheduling and monitoring.
- S3 lifecycle management for cost optimization.
- Security through IAM roles and encryption.

## Setup and Configuration

### Step 1: Set Up Amazon RDS
1. Go to the **AWS Management Console** > **RDS**.
2. Create an RDS instance with your preferred engine.
3. Enable automated backups and note the **DB Instance Identifier**.

### Step 2: Set Up Amazon S3
1. Go to **S3** and create a new bucket.
2. Enable **server-side encryption** and configure permissions.
3. Set up a lifecycle rule to transition data to Glacier.

### Step 3: Configure IAM Role
1. Create an **IAM role** with permissions for RDS, S3, and CloudWatch.
2. Attach this role to your Lambda function.

### Step 4: Create AWS Lambda Function
1. Go to **AWS Lambda** and create a new function.
2. Set the runtime to **Python 3.x**.
3. Add the provided Lambda code (in the `/src` folder) to the function.
4. Attach the IAM role created earlier.

### Step 5: Schedule with CloudWatch
1. Go to **CloudWatch** > **Rules**.
2. Create a rule to trigger the Lambda function on your schedule.

## Testing and Usage
1. Manually trigger the Lambda function from the AWS console and review CloudWatch logs.
2. Check S3 for the backup metadata files.
3. Schedule the function using CloudWatch Events and verify scheduled executions.

## Cost Optimization
- Use S3 lifecycle policies to move backups to Glacier.
- Optimize Lambda function settings to reduce costs.

## Security and Compliance
- Use encryption for RDS and S3.
- Implement least-privilege access for IAM roles.
- Configure CloudWatch alarms for error monitoring.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ
- **Snapshot Creation Issues**: Check RDS access and IAM permissions.
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase Lambda function timeout.
- **Access Denied**: Verify IAM roles have correct permissions.
